				<h3>Abstract</h3>
				<div>
				<p>Gyms can be jam-packed and can be hard for members to have a good workout in certain interval of time. As equipment are always taken by another member in the gym it would be really uncomfortable for you to wait beside him/her while he/she works out. I then decided to conduct various experiments in the gym to over come this solution. I then decided to create a feature where a member gets to see all the information with respect to the no of equipment available to use and also giving the member an option to book for equipment so he wouldn't need to wait next to a person while they're working out. With this feature, the members of the Gym can stay at home and look at the no of equipment being used and thereby make a decision to whether go to the gym or not. The feature is added to an existing app. (PureGym App) In this report, you'll be able to see two mid-fi prototypes of the feature, methodologies used to conduct User testing along with two user test results of the prototypes. You'll also be able to see the feedback given by each User with respect to the feature's functionality and design.</p>
